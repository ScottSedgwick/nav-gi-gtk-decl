# Nav-GI-GTK-Declarative

Haskell navigation library, but experimenting with gi-gtk-declarative to create a user interface.

_In theory_, you should be able to check out the repo and build with Stack and it should just work.

_In theory_, theory and practice are the same.

If theory and practice disagree, tell me what happened.

At the moment it is still a bit primitive, and the UI is not really started yet.  I'll update this message when I turn it into something useful.
